Temperature Control Program

Description
This C++ program simulates a simple temperature control system using a `heater` class. It allows the user to increase or decrease the temperature and displays the updated temperature.

Features
-   Allows the user to increase or decrease the temperature.
-   Displays the current temperature.
-   Provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
-   Continues to operate until the user chooses to exit.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:
-   main.cpp: Contains the main function with the program logic to interact with the user and control the temperature.
-   header.h: Contains the declaration of the `heater` class.
-   implementation.cpp: Contains the implementation of the `heater` class member functions.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string:  For handling string input (even though not directly used here, it's included in the header). [cite: 7, 19]

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the code in the respective files (main.cpp, header.h, and implementation.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
